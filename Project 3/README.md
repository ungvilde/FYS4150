# Simulating particles in a Penning trap

We simulate the movement of particles in a Penning trap. 
The repository contains the following files and folders:

- **simulate_one_two_particles.cpp**: Run experiments for single particle and two particles in Penning trap
- **simulate_time_dependence**: Run experiments with time-varying electric field
- **plot.py**: plots the relevant figures
- **plot_functions.py**: holds the functions used for plotting
- **data**: where data files from numerical experiments are stored
- **figs**: where we have the plots

To compile and run the C++ programs, run
> make all
