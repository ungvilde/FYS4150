# Simulate the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation
We wanted to see the quantum effects of a particle moving through two slits. This program simulates a 1 x 1 box with dirichlet conditions at the boundary, so that the edges work as a reflective surface. Particle is represented by a probability distribution and the simulation utilizes the Born rule to see the effects. It gives the probability of one-slit and three-slit aswell with a wall at x = 0.8.
