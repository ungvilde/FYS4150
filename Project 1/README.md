# First project of class FYS4150
**DEADLINE: 13. September 2022, kl. 23:59**

Delivery: .pdf with answers to the questions are to be delivered in canvas. Code with comments should be on a GitHub repository that has been linked to in the .pdf.
## Project description
This project does not need to be a full scientific report. You need only to answer the questions. Everyone in the group has to join the same project group on canvas (Group 8). **Repository should include a README.md-file that explains how the code should be compiled and run in order to reproduce your results/errors.**

Figures have to be made as vector graphics (.pdf). Matplotlib.pyplot can be forced to save this as "plt.savefig("figure.pdf")".
