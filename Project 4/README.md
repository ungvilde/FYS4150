# Ising model in two dimensions to simulate ferromagnet enviroment
We use the Ising model to simulate the temperature-dependent behavior in ferromagnets. We want to estimate the critical temperature where the system undergoes a phase transition, where the ferromagnets go from magnetized to a non-magnetized state.
